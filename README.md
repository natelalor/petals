### My first _real_ game creation
Petals is a game I built using C++ and SFML. I have been interested in learning more about game development, so during a break between my classes at university, I set out to teach myself more about it--and this is the result! While I have worked on a C++ game as part of a school project (which you can see [here](https://github.com/natelalor/Enriching-Dessert-Game)), I wanted to learn on my own and really sink my teeth into this interesting topic.

In this game, you have to balance the number of petals you have to keep your flower alive. Using RNG, watering your flower adds petals, and a bee may come at your command to take some petals away.

I learned a lot throughout this project. I have written about it throughout my process. If you're interested, I will provide a link to my full documentation [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OnkanwgTEmq9fcNMQN6lvr8LENYEdgZLTu6KEbdk1Ik/edit?usp=sharing).
