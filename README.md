## goals
wanted to diversify my skillset
look more into game-development/design

## process
I've been learning computer science for multiple years now, and just recently I've started to think about game development. I grew up a gamer, and I wanted a chance to turn the tables and see how a game would be created. With that in mind, I waited for a break between my university assignments where I had some time to dig in and tackle this interesting new topic. I set into this project with some past knowledge of C++, CMake, as well as a lot of experience playing games and creative thinking. 

The next step was initial planning. I needed to think through how the game would look, what the user functionality would be like, and well, what the game would be! After a few days of brainstorming, I decided on a playful game style that would reflect my creative and enthusiastic side. I finalized what I wanted the game to be, and started to think about code structure. How would I actually bring this to life in C++? What IDE should I use? How do I use rendering integration with C++? CLion?

Obviously, as soon as one question was answered, 3 more were replaced. But I was loving this progression of work - I wanted to start from scratch and answer all the questions as I went. This is a fun side of coding that I found more enjoyable than I thought - This project was all mine, and I could go about this exactly how I wanted. Further, as I got more and more into the 'game development rabbit hole', I realized this side of coding integrated creativity a lot more than other coding. While I think I still prefer other coding use-cases, game development was a refreshing change. 

Next, I had to figure out what to pair with C++ to make visuals and a game presentation for the user. After some advice-seeking from peers, I spent a while using Xcode and Metal for MacOS rendering. This seemed approachable to me because I had just finished a project using Xcode & Swift, so there wasn't much dust to brush off. As I started working, however, more and more problems seemed to arise. Because I already had a predetermined look and style for my game in my head and sketched out, I realized Metal may not be the best solution. While it is a terrific graphics framework, I wanted something that was more customizable to fit my specific needs. So, after some time trying to make it work with Metal, I was back to the drawing board. 

## conclusion
how you felt about it?
